This application allows the user to generate a choice-specific workout regime.

Built with: HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQUERY.

Facts:
RepEnhancer pulls from a database of over 300+ workouts to ensure that every workout is uniquely generated.

Approach:
I wanted to build an app that will motivate people to continue to train and push their limits. I hosted this site and will allow individuals from my gym, LA Fitness of Norwalk, and everyone else that is interested to utilize it as a tool to enhance their workout regime and empower them to continue staying fit. 

Hurdles:
There were a few bugs that became evident when trying to optimize the functionality of the app. To start, there were a lot of messy code when it came to CSS. When trying for responsiveness, I was running into issues with total responsiveness on all browsers because I did not use the appropriate -webkit- tools. Initially, it was fully responsive on chrome but not safari or mozzila. Since people will mostly be accesing this application on the iphone, I switched it so that the most responsiveness was from safari. Chrome and mozilla are a little messy. Second, I had some logic issues with the javascript. However, I was able to figure this out after pseudo-coding the process. Overall, I am happy with the design and the speed of "fetch" from API. I hope people will utilize this application. I will continue to update RepEnhancer in the weeks to come.
